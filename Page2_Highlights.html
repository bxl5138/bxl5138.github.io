        <h1> Internship with GE Transportation </h1>
        <h4> During Summer 2015, I worked at GET's Erie location as an Electronic Test Development Intern. I had several projects, but the main one was simulating motor feedback as part of a motor controller test circuit. To this end, I spent 8 weeks working with the Arduino microcontroller, learning C programming to optimize performance. My experience here was productive and fulfilling, as I learned about microcontrollers, test engineering, and professional life. Plus, I lived next to a beautiful state park with 200 other interns! </h4>

       <h1> HackPSU Spring 2015 </h1>
       <h4> My first (and frankly, long overdue) foray into hacker culture took place in March 2015. I teamed up with two friends, and in 24 hours, we designed and implemented a multi-functional audio equalizer on a 32x32 LED panel. Users could tap a button on the keyboard to watch our progression through increasingly complex visual displays, and the board functioned with both computer and guitar input. Proudly, we were rewarded for our efforts with both "Best Hardware Hack," as well as "Best Hack by First-time Hackers." </h4>

      <h1> Hacker Paradise </h1>
      <h4> At the end of Summer 2015, I spent 2 weeks in Berlin practicing German, learning HTML and CSS, and putting them to good use (see: this website). The trip was not only productive, but also quite eye-opening; I'd never traveled abroad alone, nor had I been to a non-English speaking country. I'm grateful to have participated in such a memorable experience and to have met such a diverse group of people. Still, I have no doubt my wanderlust has only been ephemerally satisfied. </h4>

      <h1> Internship with Verizon Communications </h1>
      <h4> I'd always wanted to live in New York City, so Verizon's internship offer in Brooklyn was a no-brainer. Adjusting was initially more difficult than I'd expected, but by the end of summer, I'd made wonderful friends and memories. I was also productive at Verizon, having replaced a 4-hour process with a 2-minute VBA macro (and saving $80,000/year in productivity). Overall, I was proud of my first real professional contribution, and my time in New York City was truly phenomenal. </h4>

      <h1> Music, Dance, and Sports </h1>
      <h4> When I need to take a break from engineering (blasphemy, I know), I find myself in student activities that range from swimming and ultimate frisbee to musical theatre and comedy writing. I have fond memories of all these experiences -- even my one-week stint on the boxing team, during which I decided weekly concussions were not for me. Still, my favorite newfound interest has been ballroom dancing, which offers a middle ground between my passion for music and the competitiveness of sport. Variety being the spice of life, I try to keep a well-stocked pantry.</h4>
